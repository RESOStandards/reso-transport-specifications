# Transport Specifications
Proposals are organized into sections based on their underlying protocol, for example the _RESO Web API_.

Specifications are divided into modular endorsements, each of which are offered separately through RESO Certification. 

RESO Endorsements use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

# RESO Web API
The following proposals use the RESO Web API as a transport mechansim.

## [Data Dictionary Endorsement](./DATA-DICTIONARY.md)
**Status**: Adopted, **Current Version**: 1.7

The Data Dictionary endorsement defines models for use in the RESO domain. These include resources, fields, lookups (a.k.a. enumerations) and relationships between resources.

## [Web API Core Endorsement](./WEB-API-CORE.md)

**Status**: Adopted, **Current Version**: 2.0.0

The Web API Core endorsement defines the primary functionality that RESO Web API servers are expected to have in order to provide both replication and live query support.

## [Web API Add/Edit Endorsement](./WEB-API-ADD-EDIT.md)
**Status**: In Review by the RESO Certification Subgroup

The Web API Add/Edit endorsement defines how to Create, Update and Delete data in the RESO Web API. 

## [Web API Expand Endorsement](./WEB-API-EXPAND.md)
**Status**: In Review by the RESO Certification Subgroup

The Web API Expand endorsement outlines requirements for those who want to use OData `$expand` functionality to nest resources within others.

## [Web API Validation Expression Endorsement](./WEB-API-VALIDATION-EXPRESSION.md)
**Status**: In Transport Backlog

Web API Validation Expressions allow for the transport of machine-executable business rules using the [RETS 019 Validation Expression grammar](https://github.com/darnjo/rcp019).

# New Change Proposals

## RCP Template
If you would like to suggest a new change proposal, please use the [**RCP Template**](./RCP-TEMPLATE.md) in this repository and fill in each section accordingly. 

## Submission Process
The process for submitting a new proposal is as follows:
* Create a new branch for the proposal by choosing the next available RCP number. 
  - The branch name should be created from the RCP number and use a short and meaningful name so others understand what the proposal does.
  - It should also include the current version of the proposal affected. 
  - If the change proposal affects an existing version, a tag should be included specifying whether the proposed changes result in a major, minor or patch change to the existing spec.
  - Example: `rcp-040-fancy-new-web-api-feature-2.0.0-major`.
* Use the RCP Template to create a change proposal.
* When the proposal is ready for review, create a Draft PR so that it may be reviewed by the community and chairs.
* If adopted, the proposal will be merged into the main branch.

Please contact [RESO Development](mailto:dev@reso.org) if you have any questions.
