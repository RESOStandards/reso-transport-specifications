# Summary of Changes
Updated external industry standard references to the current ratified standards.

<br /><br />

# Introduction
This proposal is to update the RFCs, etc. with reference to the currently ratified updates for standards that WebApi is built upon. 

<br /><br />

# Section 1: Purpose
We want to ensure secure and reliable foundations for the transport layer.  This requires remaining in-sync with the rest of the technology industries.

The current references are identified as possibly unsecure implementations. [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Websites)
<br /><br />

# Section 2: Specification
Standards updated in the proposal: 
* [RFC-8446 - TLS v1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446)
* [RFC-8164 - Opertunistic Security for HTTP/2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8164)
* [RFC-8740 - HTTP/2 over TLSv1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8740)

<br /><br />

# Section 3: Certification

Certification tooling will need to be updated to support the new standards.
