# RESO Payloads Endorsement
The following proposal defines the data availability testing rules for payloads testing, which is required as part of Data Dictionary 1.7 in order to ensure that what's being provided in a given payload matches what's in the metadata. 

The [Payloads specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNMqmDdK0C31tKrfdZnHIk1WmJPbAuluV_eJbErddCo/edit?usp=sharing) also defines availability requirements for the IDX Payload Endorsement.
